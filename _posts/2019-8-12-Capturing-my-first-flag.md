&nbsp;

It was during my first week as a freshman at my university, I happened to see a poster in one of the hallways about a challenge which can be completed to win some new hardware. Obviously, it had a link, <https://securehardware.in> and I looked it up.
&nbsp;

On the page, was a logic gate problem, with a number of OR and AND gates connected together, a virutal electronic circuit with a keypad and LCD display connected to it. After reading the instructions, I figured out that I'd have to solve the problem and enter the result as the password on the keypad.
&nbsp;

I solved the logic gate problem, converted the binary result into decimal, and entered it on the keypad.

&nbsp;
**'FLAG-RN1281STMBA'**

What was displayed on the LCD screen for a split of a second, was the first flag I've ever captured. Obviously, it made no sense at first. I had to read the instructions and everything on the webpage countless times to crack the fact that, the flag is actually an address. &nbsp;
The address of Amrita Cybersecurity Lab!

&nbsp;
But still, there was this unclickable button titled 'Enter the details', still hanging above the footer of the page, and I was quite intruiged by it. And the hint, displayed just above the button read, 'the source of your inspiration'.
I knew that it meant something and it took me a long while to crack the fact that it could be talking about the source code of the web page.
&nbsp;

And there it was, just near the code of button I talked about earlier, a Google form link, asking you to enter your details , written as a comment.
&nbsp;

And that's how I captured my first flag!
