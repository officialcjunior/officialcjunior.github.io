title: Completing the amFOSS tasks

&nbsp;

Hello! &nbsp;

For the past three weeks, I've been completing the tasks given by amFOSS for freshers for joining the club. It has been a spectacular 
journey in which I got to learn so much about different programing languages, computers, what goes under the hood, and about myself. 
&nbsp;

This blog post is mainly about how I completed the tasks.
&nbsp;

For controling my repository, I used GitKraken, which is a very popular Git client from Axosoft.
&nbsp;

Task-0 &nbsp;

Task-0 was easy, as I already had Ubuntu on my laptop. I had installed Ubuntu 19.04, from a USB stick conatining the .iso connected to it.
As I had been running linux previously, I vaguely had an idea about how the Ubuntu installer works and did not encounter any problem in installing it.

&nbsp;

Task-1 &nbsp;

As I had never went down anywhere near Developer Tools, I was a bit skeptical about running the script to star all the repositories. But, the clearly illustrated Readme file on the GitHub page made me do it efforrlessly.

&nbsp;

Task -2 &nbsp;

In the programming tasks, I started with the ones from HackerRank. Python was a new language for me, at the time. So I was looking up for the equivalent code for the C++ codes I've wrote to find the solution.

&nbsp;
The time conversion problem took me a little bit of time to complete. I didn't know that libraries like existed, who could convert the input into the 24 hour format just like that.

&nbsp;
I also had some trouble wrapping my head around how to input the numbers in the problem Next Round from Codeforces. After looking it up about it and referring to various books, I figured out that map() would do the trick.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Task-3 &nbsp;

Here, I used the Chrome Developer Tools to find the css tag of the search result links and a do loop to convert the greater than sign to slashes.
The Nokogiri HTML Parser, used to retrieving the results are stored as a dependency, in the gemfile.

&nbsp;

Task-4 &nbsp;

Advanced XOR was a bit challenging.
I found out the key length as the get_key function is recursively called until the key length != 5.
Unfortunately, I couldn't find a way to extract the plaintext. 

&nbsp;

Task-5 &nbsp;

As GitHub v4 uses GraphQL, I thought I'd learn more about that first.

I've handled the scenario to give out an error message if the profile doesn't exist or if anything happens internally.

As part of Authorization header of the request, I had to get my PAT key from GitHub and add it.

&nbsp;

Task-6 &nbsp;

I had particularly kept my eye on the CLI App since the first time I ran my eyes through the list of tasks. I always wanted to learn and work with Go. 
Firstly, I took the tour on Golang and watched a couple of videos on YouTube to learn about the basic syntax and later dived more into the foundations.
&nbsp;

Meanwhile, I found out about Go package Anaconda, which is a wrapper of the Twitter API.
&nbsp;

Of course, Twitter doesn't give out their data to simple requests just like that, so I had to apply for a developers account on Twitter and get their access token to authenticate the request my program was going to make.
&nbsp;

Writing the retrieved data to a .txt file was way easier than I thought it would be. 
&nbsp;

Anaconda and Go was a litte hard to understand at first, as the indentation, the arguments and syntax were very different to those of I know about. But, after tinkering around it, I got used to it.

&nbsp;

Task -7 &nbsp;

From Rust's documentation website, I followed the example of regex crate usage. I imported that into my code and used it to compare the string entered with the pattern of the email address.

&nbsp;

Task-8 &nbsp;

Captcha breaking was something I ruled out at first to resolved at the end of all other tasks, as I thought that I would need to spend a lot of time learning about it.
I had used online tools to convert .jpg to .txt before and the term 'OCR' was always on the back of my mind. After looking it up about it, I found about pytesseract, which will recognize text from images.
The project page on Github had a lot of clearly explained examples about how to use it so all I had to do was pick the right one.

I made the .png file using Arial font and exported it out as a screenshot, after typing it out in the biggest size possible.

<https://github.com/officialcjunior/amfoss-tasks/tree/master/task-8>

And here's the link to pytesseraact:
<https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/>
&nbsp;

Task-9 &nbsp;

For my personal website, I forked Jekyll Now, which is an open source website generator, developed by Barry Clark.

As it had everything neatly explained in comments, all I had to do was edit out the necessary part on the _config.yml file and push it onto my repository.

Each post is saved as a Markdown file so I finished writing out the post without much research.

Task- 10 &nbsp;

This is the one of those part of the tasks of which I'm very grateful about. Watching the CS50 lectures cleared some of the ambiguity I had around various stuff around the very foundations of computer science. Each lecture had something new for me. I particularly loved Lecture 3, where he taught about how the common sorting algorithms worked. Lecture 6 about HTTP also had a lot of stuff I had no idea about.
&nbsp;

Looking back, I feel like I've learned much about how each programing languages work, a lot about how different things work from the behind and how powerful a single line of code can be.
&nbsp;

I'm interested in coding and solving problems and making life easier with technology.How
I'll volunteer and consistently try to increase the outreach for the programmes organised by the club. I'll persistently do learn and share my knowledge in technology to the community in the long run.
