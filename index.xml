The cadence of these notes will vary like a meandering river as it was not easy to connect different things and also keep the same voice – &amp;ldquo;I am not an expert; I&amp;rsquo;m just writing it down as I fare forward and figure it out&amp;rdquo; throughout the blog. I also feel this blog post lacks a certain standard of emotional density that I thought this would have when I envisioned writing it.</description></item><item><title>Jerusalem</title><link>/blog/jerusalem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/jerusalem/</guid><description>This is the caption I wrote for an Instagram post about Jerusalem, when I visited it in July 2022. More about the trip can be read on a previous post − Notes from Israel.
Recently, I read it again and thought it was post-worthy, so here it is:
To get lost in the beauty and the aesthetics of the Old City of Jerusalem, you won&amp;rsquo;t need to try or look closely.</description></item><item><title>A September Visit To My Hometown</title><link>/blog/september-2023-home-visit/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/september-2023-home-visit/</guid><description>This is a rundown of my experience of a visit I made to my hometown and family in September 2023. There&amp;rsquo;s a place where I build and keep some personal narratives, and I found this there while searching for something else yesterday. I felt that it was post-worthy so here it is.
My September visit to home—a week-long halt at Chalakudy—ended on the thirteenth and I have come back to the city with a reminder that working on myself, usually career, is always the best thing to do and brings the most happiness and satisfaction.</description></item><item><title>Brick by brick – my four years at Amrita University</title><link>/blog/college/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/college/</guid><description>For reading or giving feedback, social proof, comments, and further discussion, see the following Twitter thread.

This is a blog post about the things I stumbled upon when I thought I&amp;rsquo;ll give OpenBSD a go. Therefore, this post is going to sound more like a walkthrough than an ordinary blog post.
The reason why I decided to try it out was primarily for the learning experience, and to use it as a hobby OS- something you boot up every once in a while when you want to slow down and relax a bit.</description></item><item><title>Google Summer Of Code 2021 report – Support for CPU and Platform Profiles</title><link>/blog/gsoc-2021/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/gsoc-2021/</guid><description>Hi all,
This blog post is a brief summary about the work I did on the summer of 2021 with Rizin on adding support for CPU and platform profiles.
Title of the project Support for CPU and platform profiles
Synopsis Rizin previously relied upon manually writing code for adding a new CPU or an IO port. This implementation was unfit as the vast and growing ecology of hardware components such as CPUs and SoCs regularly implement a part of architecture with custom instructions, registers, and address configurations with trivial differences, making it infeasible to maintain all of them inside Rizin.</description></item><item><title>Preserving the commons in computing</title><link>/blog/the-commons-in-computing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/the-commons-in-computing/</guid><description>I must begin by expressing the joy that is unspeakable to be born in this era and to be using this impressive technology that is computers, to the fullest and is thankful to be able to develop software on them with the least effort and price than it was ever before. For that, I think I must heed the engineers of the past, who knew what they were doing, and to the companies for manufacturing electronics and their ideas.</description></item><item><title>InCTF Internationals- author's writeup for Invisible Maze</title><link>/blog/inctfi-invisible-maze/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/inctfi-invisible-maze/</guid><description>For inCTF International Edition 2020, I had so much fun in making a Gameboy ROM reversing challenge.

For those who haven&amp;rsquo;t heard about it, the Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse.
When I held the Pi in my palm, the first thing I realized is that, like a real raspberry, it was indeed, very small.</description></item><item><title/><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Aswin. I&amp;rsquo;m a 22 year old Malayali from Kerala, currently living in Bengaluru. I love to do software engineering, writing, photo-videography, and play music.
I want to build new things to improve the world through engineering or through other creative outputs.
Here are some of my interests:
Computer science: I like computers and what is possible with them. At the beginning of my &amp;ldquo;computer journey&amp;rdquo;, as a freshman at my university, I was exclusively interested in systems.</description></item><item><title/><link>/bookshelf/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/bookshelf/</guid><description>This is a list of books I&amp;rsquo;ve read and enjoyed.

An Era of Darkness: The British Empire in India – Shashi Tharoor Although the book presents an incessantly one-sided narrative, its descriptions and style of writing is engaging, and does not fail to deliver the unparalleled joy of reading a Tharoor.</description></item><item><title/><link>/tech/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tech/</guid><description>Talks State of Rust in the Linux kernel – a talk I gave at Bangalore Rust community&amp;rsquo;s October 2023 meetup: Slides
