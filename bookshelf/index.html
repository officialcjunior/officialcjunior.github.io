This page is inspired from <a href=https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf>Patrick Collison&rsquo;s</a> Bookshelf.</p><p>&ldquo;Since the stacks and shelves lack any particular order, so too does this list.&rdquo;</p><hr><h4 id=sapiens-a-brief-history-of-humankind--yuval-noah-harari>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind – Yuval Noah Harari</h4><p>Life-altering insights about human origins, civilization, religion,
empires, science, technology, and human nature.</p><h4 id=an-era-of-darkness-the-british-empire-in-india--shashi-tharoor>An Era of Darkness: The British Empire in India – Shashi Tharoor</h4><p>Although the book presents an incessantly one-sided narrative, its descriptions and style of writing is engaging, and does not fail to deliver the unparalleled joy of reading a Tharoor. Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/chandanaveli/status/1697308569945911338?s=20">my tweet thread</a> about the book.</p><h4 id=the-god-of-small-things--arundhati-roy>The God of Small Things – Arundhati Roy</h4><p>Possibly the best English fiction with a story set in Kerala. Incredible storyline and style of writing.</p><h4 id=the-legends-of-khasak--ov-vijayan>The Legends of Khasak – O.V Vijayan</h4><p>English translation of the best Malayalam novel ever. Timeless. Legendary.
Tags: culturally dense, mythology, religion, perception of time
and place.</p><h4 id=zero-to-one--peter-theil>Zero To One – Peter Theil</h4><p>Insights about what&rsquo;s possible and how to shape our future
in a modern industrial society like ours.</p><h4 id=12-rules-for-life---jordan-peterson>12 Rules for Life - Jordan Peterson</h4><p>A good-quality self-improvement book. The first chapter of the book, about the first rule, is one of the most inspiring words I&rsquo;ve ever read. I liked how he connected history and evolution in that. Rest
are pretty much like any other self-help books.</p><h4 id=the-power-of-now--eckhart-tolle>The Power of Now – Eckhart Tolle</h4><p>The book looks at spiritual and meditative guidelines and insights of all
major religions from a modern perspective. Some chapters—especially, the
part about listening to your body—are evocative and &ldquo;works&rdquo;.</p><h4 id=the-motorcycle-diaries--ernesto-che-guevara>The Motorcycle Diaries – Ernesto Che Guevara</h4><p>Vivid description of a continent, culture, travel, colonialism and life
in the 60s.
Very well-written. Small and portable book.</p><h4 id=hippie--paulo-coelho>Hippie – Paulo Coelho</h4><p>About Paulo&rsquo;s time as a hippie backpacking through Europe.
About relentless freedom of being alone and youthful indiscretion.</p><h4 id=the-alchemist--paulo-coelho>The Alchemist – Paulo Coelho</h4><p>Takeaway: &ldquo;follow your dreams&rdquo;.</p><h4 id=disgrace--j-m-coetzee>Disgrace – J. M. Coetzee</h4><p>I&rsquo;m not sure why this book won a Booker Prize.</p><h4 id=friendly-ambitious-nerd--visakan-veerasamy>Friendly Ambitious Nerd – Visakan Veerasamy</h4><p>A collection of ideas to become more friendly and ambitious – an invitation to bring the tamed and scrutinized part of our inner-self forward and manifest with glory. Here&rsquo;s my <a href="https://x.com/chandanaveli/status/1720796951523016887?s=20">Twitter thread</a> about the book.</p><h4 id=to-kill-a-mockinbird--harper-lee>To Kill a Mockinbird – Harper Lee</h4><p>Harper Lee&rsquo;s style, imagery and poise forces readers to achieve feats such as finishing the book faster than the reader ever thought was possible.</p><h4 id=ntuppuppakkoranendarnnu-my-granddad-had-an-elephant--basheer>Ntuppuppakkoranendarnnu (My Granddad Had an Elephant!) – Basheer</h4><p>Good and short novel. Nothing fancy. Basheer also talks a lot about
Islam through Kunjupattumma in the book, which was interesting to read.
Even though the book has a predictable ending, the last chapter was a
satisfying read.</p><h4 id=the-ministry-of-utmost-happiness--arundhati-roy>The Ministry of Utmost Happiness – Arundhati Roy</h4><p>Very dense portrait of life in Delhi and India.
Mostly sad. Has a bit of happiness at the end.</p><h4 id=the-almanack-of-naval-ravikant--eric-jorgenson>The Almanack of Naval Ravikant – Eric Jorgenson</h4><p>A modern handy handbook about wealth, happiness, success, and spirituality.
Basically, the text version of Joe Rogan podcast&rsquo;s episode with Naval.</p></main><footer><script src=//yihui.org/js/math-code.js></script><script async src="//mathjax.rstudio.com/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML"></script><script async src=//yihui.org/js/center-img.js></script><hr>Aswin&rsquo;s blog<br><a href=/index.xml>RSS Feed</a></footer></body></html>
