I&rsquo;m a 22 year old <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayali>Malayali</a> from Kerala, currently living in Bengaluru.</p><p>I want to build new things to improve the world through engineering or through other creative outputs.</p><hr><p>Here are some of my interests:</p><h3 id=computer-science>Computer science:</h3><p>I am a Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate
from <a href=https://amrita.edu>Amrita University</a>, Kollam. At my university, I was a member of a student-run computer
security club at my universityâ€”<a href=https://bi0s.in>teambi0s</a>.
At bi0s, I used to mentor students, manage the team, work on various projects and play CTFs. I&rsquo;m also a
member of <a href=https://rizin.re>Rizin</a> - which is an Open Source organization that makes reverse engineering frameworks.</p><p>I like computers and what is possible with them. At the beginning of my &ldquo;computer journey&rdquo;, as a freshman at my university, I was exclusively interested in systems. But lately, as I got acquainted
with other things of the stack, I like almost all parts of it.</p><p>More can be found on my <a href=/tech>technical talks and projects</a> page of this website and my Github: <a href=https://github.com/officialcjunior>@officialcjunior</a></p><h3 id=everything-else>Everything else</h3><p>I like writing, music, art and its aesthetics, especially: photography, filmmaking, pianos, and writing.
