Here are some of them
and what I like to work on and learn more about:</p><h3 id=computer-science>Computer science:</h3><p>Currently, I&rsquo;m a senior year Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate
at <a href=https://amrita.edu>Amrita University</a>, Kollam. I&rsquo;m a member of a student-run computer
security club at my university- <a href=https://bi0s.in>teambi0s</a>- a
club founded and mentored by <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/vipin-pavithran>Vipin Pavithran</a>.
At bi0s, I mentor students, manage the team, work on various projects and play CTFs. I&rsquo;m also a
member of <a href=https://rizin.re>Rizin</a>- which is an Open Source organization that makes reverse
engineering frameworks. I am into Open Source software and can be seen talking about
computers, linux and everything else in its realm.</p><p>I like computers in general. I was introduced to reverse engineering and other low-level particulars
at the beginning of my &ldquo;computer journey&rdquo; as a freshman at my university. But lately, as I got acquainted
with other things of the stack, I consider myself a software developer in general, and I like almost all parts
of the stack. I&rsquo;m the most into operating systems- Linux, server administration, software design,
intelligent systems and computer security.</p><h3 id=art>Art</h3><p>I like art and its aesthetics, especially: filmography, photography and writing. I put my writings on
this blog, my everyday thoughts on Twitter, and my photos and bit of cinema on Instagram. I like silent
and slow movies- the kind Alfonso Cuaron and Michael Haneke usually create.</p><p>I also love to play the piano and the guitar.</p><h3 id=life>Life</h3><p>I like rational discussions about life, the Universe, and the
meaning and theory of everything. Therefore, I&rsquo;m also into:</p><ul><li>Philosophy: ideas for self-improvement.</li><li>Biology: how life and consciousness work.</li><li>Neuroscience: how the brain- thinking and memory- works and brain-computer interfaces.</li><li>Mathematics: how you can abstract many things around us- many things of the universe- with mathematical models.</li><li>Physics: elementary physics- about the fundamental structures of the universe.</li></ul><p>I&rsquo;d love to hear from you and have a chat.
