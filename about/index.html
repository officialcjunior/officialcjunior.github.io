at <a href=https://amrita.edu>Amrita University</a>, Kollam.</p><p>I&rsquo;m a member of student-run computer security club at my university- <a href=https://bi0s.in>teambi0s</a>.
At bi0s, I mentor students, manage the team, work on various projects and play CTFs. I&rsquo;m also a
member of <a href=https://rizin.re>Rizin</a>- which is an Open Source organization that makes reverse
engineering frameworks. I am into Open Source software and can be seen talking about
Firefox, Arch Linux and everything else in its realm.</p><p>I like computers in general. I was introduced and into reverse engineering and other low-level particulars
at the beginning of my &ldquo;computer journey&rdquo; as a freshman at my university. But lately, as I got acquainted
with other things of the stack, I consider myself as a software developer, in general, as I like almost all parts
of the stack. I hope to make a condierable impact on the world somehow through computers and software.</p><p>I like art, especially: filmography, photography and writing. I put my writings on this blog and Twitter,
and my photos and cinema on my Instagram. I like rational discussions about life, Universe and the
meaning of everything.</p><p>Various ways of contacting me exists:</p><p>Mail: <a href=mailto:realc@protonmail.com>realc@protonmail.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=https://twitter.com/cjuniorstweets>cjuniorstweets</a> - Most of them are just Tweets</p><p>Instagram: <a href=https://instagram.com/officialcjunior>officialcjuniot</a> - Mostly art, photography and (short) cinema</p><p>Mastodon (occassionaly used): <a href=https://oldbytes.space/officialcjunior>officialcjunior</a></p></main><footer><script src=//yihui.org/js/math-code.js></script><script async src="//mathjax.rstudio.com/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML"></script><script async src=//yihui.org/js/center-img.js></script><hr>Aswin&rsquo;s blog<br><a href=/index.xml>subscribe</a></footer></body></html>
