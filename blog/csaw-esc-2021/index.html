competition about security of embedded systems and devices. Each year, the competition comes with a
different theme and the time around, it was about Side Channel and Fault Injection attacks with
the ChipWhisperer Nano. The team and I had a fun time learning and getting used to them.</p><p>This blog is aimed at giving a short glimpse on what SCAs and other things in its realm are in a nutshell.
In between, I&rsquo;ll be explaining how we approached a few of the challenges, as well.</p><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>Side channel attacks (SCAs) and Fault Injection attacks (FIAs)
fall under the attack vectors which target the external particulars of the
computer system instead of trying to exploit the actual
software or cryptographic protocol. Figuring out
what a computer is doing by analysing the power usage statistics, i.e.,
understanding something using a &ldquo;side channel&rdquo;, is a fine example of what an SCA is.
Historically, these vectors are often detected and utilized through the holes
left open by the chip manufacturers or the system vendors. For example, trying to
sneak in through the parts of the debug mode of a chip or through some other information left by the
software’s operation. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)>Spectre</a>
is probably the most famous and easily relatable example of a vulnerability that is
exploited through a Side Channel Attack.</p><p>Before jumping right into SCAs, let me elaborate a bit on the scheme of things so that you&rsquo;ll
feel more used to the workflow of CSAW ESC, ChipWhisperer and the things that I&rsquo;ll be talking about.</p><h3 id=a-little-on-the-chipwhisperer>A little on the ChipWhisperer</h3><p>We&rsquo;ll be talking about doing Side Channel Attacks with a ChipWhisperer.</p><p>The <a href=https://rtfm.newae.com/Capture/ChipWhisperer-Nano/>ChipWhisperer Nano</a>
is a device which provides a fast and easy way to learn and get used to Side Channel and
Fault Injection attacks. It&rsquo;s a small device and it&rsquo;s
regularly used for training and research purposes. The device has two sections: one that has
the target and the other that is used for measurement purposes. The target
is a STM32F030F4P6 which has 16KB of FLASH and 4KB of SRAM. The target is where we&rsquo;ll
be flashing (loading) our files into.</p><p>The ChipWhisperer has a great, free and open source software toolchain and it&rsquo;s available
as a <a href=https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer>Python package</a>. It&rsquo;s built on
top of PyUSB and allows seamless interaction with all parts of the device in Python and
offers amazing APIs.</p><h3 id=the-workflow-of-csaw-esc-2021>The workflow of CSAW ESC 2021</h3><p>For each challenge (puzzle or the CTF problem), the precompiled (<code>.hex</code>) file and the pseudo-
code (<code>.c</code>) files are given.</p><p>The <code>.hex</code> file is what you flash onto the target of the ChipWhisperer and the pseudo-code file is to
understand what&rsquo;s been implemented in that challenge. The <code>.c</code> file is more of like the
actual source code of the challenge, but it&rsquo;ll only have enough information to let you
know about what it does and what you need to do.</p><p>Therefore, the workflow for each challenge is:</p><ul><li>Flash the <code>.hex</code> file onto the ChipWhisperer.</li><li>Take a look at the psuedo-code and understand the challenge.</li><li>Using the toolchain, interact with the device and exploit it.</li></ul><h2 id=side-channel-attacks>Side Channel Attacks</h2><p>We defined what SCAs are a while ago: they target the implementation of the system.</p><p>SCAs are broadly subdivided on the basis of the source of the data. Generally,
you&rsquo;ll hear about Timing Attacks and Power Analysis attacks, and that means
that the time and the power taken are taken into consideration and analyzed, respectively.</p><h3 id=power-analysis-attacks>Power Analysis Attacks</h3><p>Simple power analysis involves making deductions from the
trends occurring in power over a period of time. This is possible as the
power consumption varies while the device performs different operations when
measured with a device such as a standard digital oscilloscope. Obviously,
this can be measured only on small embedded devices.</p><p>But the ChipWhisperer makes things a lot easier. You can just call a
particular API and it&rsquo;ll return the power traces as a Python List. We&rsquo;ll get to all of
that shortly.</p><p>We&rsquo;ll begin by taking a look at this code, which is the pseudo code of the
challenge <code>recall</code> from the first set of challenges of the CSAW 2021 Finals.
You can grab the full source <a href=https://github.com/TrustworthyComputing/csaw_esc_2021/blob/main/challenges/set-1/recall/recall.c>here</a>.</p><p>Just take a look at the loop and how the elements of the <code>data</code> (our input) are
compared and handled.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-c data-lang=c><span style=color:#75715e>// DUMMY VAL

</code></pre></div><p>The function stops comparing the moment it finds an incorrect character, breaks and writes a
zero through the <a href=https://chipwhisperer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simpleserial.html>SimpleSerial</a>
protocol. This makes the code take different amount of time and power to complete its execution
depending on the input. In each iteration of <code>i</code>, an incorrect character will take a particular amount of
time and the correct input will take more time, since it&rsquo;ll start comparing the
next letter. This makes this program vulnerable to a power analysis attack.</p><p>Now, let&rsquo;s see what sort of APIs the ChipWhisperer has in its sleeves to aid us in power analysis.</p><p>The toolchain offers <a href=https://chipwhisperer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#chipwhisperer.capture.scopes.OpenADC.capture>scope.capture()</a> and
<a href=https://chipwhisperer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#chipwhisperer.capture.scopes.OpenADC.get_last_trace>scope.get_last_trace()</a> which
can help us with this. <code>scope.capture()</code> does the trace and <code>get_last_trace()</code> returns the traces, which are
basically an array of values.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s get a function that returns the power traces when a particular input is sent.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=color:#66d9ef>def</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>get_trace</span>(password_guess):

</code></pre></div><p>Alright, our plan here is to try out all possible characters (<code>uint8_t</code>,
so very bruteforce-able) for each of the characters, pass the string to <code>get_trace()</code>,
compute absolute differences of the traces and see which character takes the most time, since
that will be the correct one.</p><p>To compute the difference, we need the trace of a completely incorrect input which
will act as a reference trace. Then, for each character of the password, we&rsquo;ll try
out every possible alphanumerals and capture the traces.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python>known_password <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> <span style=color:#e6db74>&#39;&#39;</span>

</code></pre></div><p>By doing something like this, we&rsquo;ll be able to crack the correct input (flag) in a short while:</p><p><img src=/images/csaw-2021/recall.gif alt></p><p>The key takeaway from this part of the blog is that SCAs eventually comes down to data handling and
about inferring from numerical observations. Almost like big data, if you will. Also understand that,
something like this is only possible on small embedded systems where there&rsquo;s less abstractions and
simple things going around.</p><h2 id=fault-injection-attacks>Fault Injection Attacks</h2><p>Fault Injections are about injecting a small quirk into the execution of the
processor so that a particular computation is skipped or faulted. In layman&rsquo;s terms,
it&rsquo;s like giving the processor a boop. The ChipWhisperer supports Clock and Voltage
glitching.</p><p>Below is the psuedo-code of the challenge <a href=https://github.com/TrustworthyComputing/csaw_esc_2021/blob/main/challenges/set-1/err0r/err0r.c>err0r</a>.

</code></pre></div><p>This one&rsquo;s fairly interesting as we have to somehow make the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check>CRC</a>
hash return different results for the same input, which is not how hash
functions or redundancy checks work. So, we&rsquo;ll try to glitch the execution while
the CRC is being calculated so that the function would return different things.</p><p>ChipWhisperer Nano supports Voltage Glitching, i.e, supports shorting the voltage pins for a very short
amount of time and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll do now. Initially, we need to set a couple of parameters which
will decide how frequently the glitch would be inserted. This is a big deal and we&rsquo;ll have to tweak it if we&rsquo;re
not getting good results. To solve <code>err0r</code>, to inject a fault, we used the <a href=https://chipwhisperer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#chipwhisperer.targets.SimpleSerial.simpleserial_read_witherrors>simpleserial_read_witherrors</a>
API from the SimpleSerial’s standard library with <code>glitch_timeout</code> set as 10 samples.</p><p>Since, our program returns the CRC hash of the input if both of the hashes
(<code>crc</code> and <code>crc_2</code>) are the same, we can just keep on glitching until it returns
something different.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=color:#66d9ef>while</span> <span style=color:#66d9ef>True</span>:

a simple <code>strcmp</code> password check somewhere. Now, imagine if you can just skip the check and
try to run the code that comes below it.</p><p>We must realize that glitching is not entirely deterministic. There are a lot of variables
around and a lot of things fighting against us and the glitches. Therefore, we can insert
glitches and only hope for the best. At least, that&rsquo;s what I understood.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>That&rsquo;s it! I hope I was able to give you a really short glimpse of what&rsquo;s SCA and what&rsquo;s possible with the ChipWhisperer.
I aimed at keeping this blog short, and of course, there are a lot of other amazing things you can do here. For all
of that, see the <a href=https://chipwhisperer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html>ChipWhisperer Wiki and tutorials</a>.
The tutorials are an amazing resource. Most of the code on this blog
and its pattern was heavily inspired from the sample code from the tutorials.</p><p>Thanks to everyone who worked on the ChipWhisperer and to all who helped answer our questions on Discord.
The hardware and the software is inspiring and is an amazing example of quality engineering.</p></main><footer><script src=//yihui.org/js/math-code.js></script><script async src="//mathjax.rstudio.com/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML"></script><script async src=//yihui.org/js/center-img.js></script><hr>Aswin&rsquo;s blog<br><a href=/index.xml>RSS Feed</a></footer></body></html>
