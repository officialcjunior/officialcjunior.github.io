adding support for CPU and platform profiles.</p><hr><p><img src=https://rizin.re/images/rizin.svg alt=rizin-image></p><h3 id=title-of-the-project>Title of the project</h3><p>Support for CPU and platform profiles</p><h3 id=synopsis>Synopsis</h3><p>Rizin previously relied upon manually writing code for adding a new CPU or an IO port. This
implementation was unfit as the vast and growing ecology of hardware components such as
CPUs and SoCs regularly implement a part of architecture with custom instructions,
registers, and address configurations with trivial differences, making it infeasible to
maintain all of them inside Rizin.</p><p>Providing a level of abstraction in handling this entropy in embedded systems by
adding support for editable CPU and platform profile was the goal of this project. This also made
adding and maintaining these ports easier with less interaction with Rizin’s core. This
project also added more flexibility in having a way of importing existing hardware
data description documents so that reverse engineering on particular chipsets is easier.
Now, it&rsquo;s also easier to memory map the peripheral accesses and registers to provide a
better reverse engineering experience. Currently, this is being extended to benefit Rizin
in terms of compatibility and the end users in terms of user experience.</p><hr><h4 id=getting-ready>Getting ready</h4><p>The microtask I had to do before the actual project began was to make an SVD parser plugin.</p><p>SVD files are files containing information about a device&rsquo;s peripherals, MMIO registers and other particulars. They are usually
made by the manufacturer. This plugin would load the data from SVD file to Rizin and add them as flags (labels) and comments,
simplifying the reverse engineering experience.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s how the SVD file of the <code>STM32F030</code> microcontroller begins:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-xml data-lang=xml><span style=color:#75715e>&lt;?xml version=&#34;1.0&#34; encoding=&#34;utf-8&#34; standalone=&#34;no&#34;?&gt;</span>

</code></pre></div><p>The plugin parses all the registers' name, size, base address and its offset to add a flag
or a label and parses its description to add a comment at its offset.</p><p>That was probably the first moderately large piece of software I had ever written from scratch. It was a bit
challenging at the beginning but eventually I got the hang of and got it into a state where I could parse some of the
register&rsquo;s description and offsets and add it as flags right before receiving the e-mail saying that I got accepted:</p><p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29057155/127342270-3863038e-aace-44c5-8feb-cc15888d03d6.png alt></p><hr><h4 id=summer-time>Summer time</h4><p>After getting accepted, the first thing I did was to remove the existing implementation of
<code>RzSyscallPorts</code> - the module which took care of the architecture and CPU specefic system registers.</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/pull/1160>Deprecate RzSyscallPort and move the existing sysregs to SDB</a></li></ul><p><code>ioports.c</code> housed <code>RzSyscallPorts</code>, which were hardcoded definitions of system registers which were iteratively searched and
served using <code>rz_syscall_get_io()</code> and other APIs. These hardcoded values are moved to SDB in this Pull Request.</p><p>A port using <code>RzSyscallPorts</code> looked like this:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-c data-lang=c>RzSyscallPort sysport_avr[] <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> {

    { <span style=color:#ae81ff>0x3d</span>, <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;SPL: Stack lower bits SP0-SP7&#34;</span> },
    ...
}
</code></pre></div><p>This Pull Request moved all of those existing definitions to SDB, which follows a format like this:</p><pre><code>SPH=reg
SPH.address=0x3e
SPH.comment=Stack higher bits SP8 SP10
</code></pre><p>Here, I made two new modules: <code>RzSysregsDB</code> and <code>RzSysregItem</code> to make this happen. <code>RzSysregsDB</code> just housed a hashtable
which paired the address of the port and an <code>RzSysregItem</code> which contained the comment, type and all the other
information related it. This Pull Request also introduced <code>rz_sysreg_get()</code> to which you can pass on the type (mmio/reg) and the offset to get the corresnponding port. This is used where these ports are displayed as comments from <code>disasm.c</code>.</p><p>After that, I jumped straight into the first phase and the crux of the project: CPU profiles.</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/pull/1193>Introduce RzArchProfile and add support for CPU profiles</a></li></ul><p>The CPU profiles, basically the files containing information about the CPUs were stored in SDB files at <code>librz/asm/cpus</code>
following a naming convention <code>arch-cpu</code> are loaded up at<code>rz_arch_profiles_init()</code> at the beginning.
Then, it&rsquo;s parsed and stored into various data structures inside <code>RzArchProfile</code>, where <code>RzArchTarget</code> houses
the name of the CPU and architecture and a pointer to <code>RzArchProfile</code> (<code>RzArchTarget</code> is currently under <code>RzAnalysis</code>).
Information about the IO registers and Extended IO registers were put inside a hashtable and the other data in normal
<code>ut64</code> and character array variables for easy and fast access.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-c++ data-lang=c++><span style=color:#66d9ef>typedef</span> <span style=color:#66d9ef>struct</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>rz_arch_profile_t</span> {

  RzArchProfile <span style=color:#f92672>*</span>profile;
} RzArchTarget;
</code></pre></div><p>The information is integrated during the analysis loop. During analysis (<code>aa</code>), <code>rz_arch_profile_add_flag_every_io()</code>
is called, which parses the two hashtables and adds the information as flags. For that, two new flagspaces were
realized: <code>registers.mmio</code> and <code>registers.extended</code> for the corresponding ones.</p><p>You can see the CPU specific registers being added as flags here. This is when loaded up with an AVR firmware and CPU set
to <code>ATmega168</code>.
You can see the registers from the CPU profiles added as flags (labels) right near
the offsets:

section (<code>iS</code> command). To implement that, I introduced <code>rz_analysis_add_io_registers_map()</code> which takes care of the job
when during the analysis loop.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>$ rizin test/bins/firmware/arduino_avr.bin

to choose the platform profile. This will let the user choose the name of the profile they want to load and Rizin will load the profile
based upon the CPU and the architecture that the user have previously set. For that, I added a new variable <code>platforms</code>
to <code>RzAsmPlugin</code> which will hold the list of all supported platforms of that architecture.</p><img src=/images/gsoc/asm-platform.png alt="Italian Trulli"><p>After that, I spend a lot of time writing unit and integration tests for both CPU and platform profiles. A lot of time went to debugging and
fixing bugs and other memory leaks. Thanks to Coverity Scan, wargio and other Continuous Integration tests, it was very easy to spot and fix them with their
help!</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/pull/1263>Add x86 IO ports and support for more platforms</a></li></ul><p>In the previous Pull Request, I had only added support for one platform profile - the one for BCM2835, which one of the Raspberry Pi runs on.</p><p>And over here, more profiles: BCM2711 and OMAP 3430 were added along with the x86 IO ports. Since the code for the module was already in,
it was just as simple as getting the data in the right format, putting it on the corresponding directory and adding it to its <code>meson.build</code> :)</p><p>Onwards!</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/officialcjunior/rz-uefi>Port r2-uefi to Rizin-land</a></li></ul><p>Folks at <a href=https://binarly.io>binarly.io</a> had made wonderful a tool named <a href=https://github.com/binarly-io/uefi_r2>uefi_r2</a> which can be used to analyze
UEFI modules. I ported that to Rizin.</p><p>This tool works by analyzing the firmware using Rizin&rsquo;s <code>RzAnalysis</code> utilities and then by checking out with the analyzed functions, strings and
all (For example, while searching for the UEFI guilds). Here, the tool is a Python package
and all the interaction with <code>rizin</code> is done through <code>rz-pipe</code>&rsquo;s Python module.</p><p>You can get plenty of information with this. For example, all the protocol GUIDs, list of boot services and its addresses can be obtained just by passing the path to the UEFI image to <code>get_summary()</code>.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=color:#f92672>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>from</span> rzuefi.uefi_analyzer <span style=color:#f92672>import</span> UefiAnalyzer

UEFI is insanely complex!</p><p>Alright, that&rsquo;s done. It was time to get back on improving the SVD plugin again.</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin-extras/pull/4>Improvements in the SVD Parser plugin</a></li></ul><p>As I said, SVD files are basically XML files. Still, it wasn&rsquo;t so easy to parse them, at least with <a href=https://dev.yorhel.nl/yxml>yxml</a> due to its small size and compact design.
We decided not to use any other XML parses since <code>yxml</code> is already used inside Rizin.
Thanks to xvilka and his comments, after a couple of days of painful debugging, I was able to parse the SVD files from
STM and add the necessary information as flags and comments!</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a quick demo!<br><img src=https://github.com/officialcjunior/rz-svd/raw/master/readme-example.gif alt></p><p>Actually, the plan to end the second phase was to create a plugin inside <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rz-lang/>rz-lang</a>- to create a
sort of wrapper above the C structs with <code>PyObject</code> and its friends so that you can interact with it from Python. Since, a solid
module for architecture (<code>RzArch</code>) hasn&rsquo;t been implemented yet, we switched plans and worked on improving the SVD plugin and other things.
Still, I hope I can create the plugin when it&rsquo;s time. That&rsquo;s just one of the things I&rsquo;m staying for at Rizin :)</p><hr><h3 id=thanks>Thanks</h3><p>I would like to thank my mentors <a href=https://github.com/xvilka>xvilka</a> and <a href=https://github.com/wargio>wargio</a> for their guidance.
