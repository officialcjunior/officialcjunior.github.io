For those who haven&rsquo;t heard about it, the Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse.</p><p>When I held the Pi in my palm, the first thing I realized is that, like a real raspberry, it was indeed, very small.</p><p>So, I connected it to my laptop using an Ethernet cable, pulled up my USB Type C connecter for the power supply, and connected the HDMI cable of the monitor and keyboard to the Pi.</p><p>My Ubuntu told me that the my Wired connection is alright, so I ran the command &lsquo;&lsquo;hostname-I&rsquo;&rsquo; on the Pi, got the IP address. I also turned on the SSH in &lsquo;&lsquo;raspi-config&rsquo;&rsquo;, so that it receives my SSH request.</p><p>So, it all looked fine, I ran the command to establish a connection to the Pi, only to receive:</p><p><code>ssh: connect to host 192.168.1.201 port 22: No route to host</code></p><p>Dang!</p><p>What did I miss?</p><p>I tried reconnecting a million times and almost read all the articles related to connecting a Raspberry Pi to Linux on the web when I realized that the problem lies in the network.</p><p>In the IPv4 settings of the wired connection, you have to pick the option <strong>Link to local</strong> rather than DHCP to make the connection happen.</p><p>I ran my command again.</p><p><img src=/images/raspberry/1.jpg alt="Connecting to my Pi"></p><p>Yes!
I could remotely control my Raspberry Pi now!</p><p>Then, I made a file small text file named text.txt and copied it to my Pi.</p><p>For that I used &lsquo;&lsquo;scp&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p><img src=/images/raspberry/2.jpg alt="Transferring to my Pi"></p><p>Raspberry Pi is indeed an engineering marvel and a wonder to work with. Looking back, I feel like I&rsquo;ve learned more about how networks work and their settings than Raspberry Pi.</p><p>Looking forward to do more awesome stuff with my Raspberry Pi soon!</p></main><footer><script src=//yihui.org/js/math-code.js></script><script async src="//mathjax.rstudio.com/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML"></script><script async src=//yihui.org/js/center-img.js></script><hr>Aswin&rsquo;s blog<br><a href=/index.xml>RSS Feed</a></footer></body></html>
