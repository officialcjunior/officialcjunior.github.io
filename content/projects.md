### Software

These are my software projects that I wrote from scratch.

[kalyani.sh](github.com/officialcjunior/kalyani)—kalyani is a simple tool to control the screen
brightness for Linux machines that can make the screen look like a Kindle for better reading experience at night.

[rz-svd](github.com/officialcjunior/rz-svd)—rz-svd is an SVD file parser plugin for Rizin framework which can parse SVD files and add the information as comments and labels simplifying the reverse engineering experience.
