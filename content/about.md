Hello, I'm Aswin.

Currently, I'm a senior year Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate 
at [Amrita University](https://amrita.edu), Kollam.

I'm a member of a student-run computer security club at my university- [teambi0s](https://bi0s.in)- a 
club founded and mentored by [Vipin Pavithran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vipin-pavithran).
At bi0s, I mentor students, manage the team, work on various projects and play CTFs. I'm also a 
member of [Rizin](https://rizin.re)- which is an Open Source organization that makes reverse 
engineering frameworks. I am into Open Source software and can be seen talking about
computers, linux and everything else in its realm.

I like computers in general. I was introduced and into reverse engineering and other low-level particulars
at the beginning of my "computer journey" as a freshman at my university. But lately, as I got acquainted
with other things of the stack, I consider myself as a software developer in general, as I like almost all parts
of the stack. I hope to make a considerable impact on the world somehow through computers and software.

I like art, especially: filmography, photography and writing. I put my writings on this blog and Twitter,
and my photos and cinema on my Instagram. I like rational discussions about life, Universe, and the
meaning and theory of everything. Therefore, I consider myself as a general enthusiast.

I'd love to hear from you and have a chat. Here are some ways to contact me:
