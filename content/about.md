Hello, I'm Aswin. I'm a 22 year old [Malayali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayali) from Kerala, currently living in Bengaluru. I love to do software engineering, writing, photo-videography, and play music.

I want to build new things to improve the world through engineering or through other creative outputs.

Here are some of my interests:

### Computer science:

I like computers and what is possible with them. At the beginning of my "computer journey", as a freshman at my university, I was exclusively interested in systems. But lately, as I got acquainted with other things of the stack, I like almost all parts of it,
and been more on the line of "make what people want".

More can be found on my [technical talks and projects](/tech) page of this website and my Github: [@officialcjunior](https://github.com/officialcjunior)

### Everything else

I like writing, music, art and its aesthetics, especially: photography, filmmaking, pianos, and writing. I put my long writings on
this blog, my everyday thoughts on Twitter, and the rest visual arts on Instagram.

More can be found on my [art portfolio](/art) page of this website and on the following social media pages.
