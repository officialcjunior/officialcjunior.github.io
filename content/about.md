Hello, I'm Aswin. I'm a 22 year old [Malayali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayali) from Kerala, currently living in Bengaluru.

I want to build new things to improve the world through engineering or through other creative outputs.

Here are some of my interests:

### Computer science:

I am a Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate
from [Amrita University](https://amrita.edu), Kollam. At my university, I was a member of a student-run computer
security club at my universityâ€”[teambi0s](https://bi0s.in).
At bi0s, I used to mentor students, manage the team, work on various projects and play CTFs. I'm also a
member of [Rizin](https://rizin.re) - which is an Open Source organization that makes reverse engineering frameworks.

I like computers and what is possible with them. At the beginning of my "computer journey", as a freshman at my university, I was exclusively interested in systems. But lately, as I got acquainted
with other things of the stack, I like almost all parts of it.

### Everything else

I like writing, music, art and its aesthetics, especially: photography, filmmaking, pianos, and writing. I put my long writings on
this blog, my everyday thoughts on Twitter, and the rest on on Instagram.

More can be found on my [art portfolio](/art) page of this website and on the following social media pages.

My current favourite and most generalized philosophy of life can summed up in this:
