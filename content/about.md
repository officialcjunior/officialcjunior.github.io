Hello, I'm Aswin. I'm a 23 year old [Malayali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayali) from Kerala, currently living in Bengaluru. I love to do software engineering, writing, photo-videography, and play music.

I like creating, solving, and working on things and products that people want to use.

I like computers and what is possible with them. At the beginning, I was exclusively interested in systems. But lately, as I got acquainted with other things of the stack and culture, I like almost all parts of it, and been more on the line of "make what people want", generally and at work. I now primarily work in the app-tier. More can be found on my [technical talks and projects](/tech) page of this website and my Github: [@officialcjunior](https://github.com/officialcjunior)


I like writing, music, art and its aesthetics, especially: photography, filmmaking, pianos, and writing. I put my long writings on this blog, my everyday thoughts on Twitter, and the rest on Instagram. More can be found on my [art](/art) page of this website and on the following social media pages.
