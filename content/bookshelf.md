# Aswin's bookshelf

This is a list of books I've read and enjoyed. Inspired by [Patrick Collison's](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf) Bookshelf.

"Since the stacks and shelves lack any particular order, so too does this list."

#### Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind – Yuval Noah Harari
Life-altering insights about human origins, civilization, religion, 
empires, science, technology, and human nature.

#### The God of Small Things – Arundhati Roy
Possibly the best English fiction with a story set in Kerala. Incredible storyline
and way of writing.

#### The Legends of Khasak – O.V Vijayan
English translation of the best Malayalam novel ever. Timeless. Legendary.
Tags: culturally dense, mythology, religion, perception of time
and place.

#### Zero To One – Peter Theil
Insights about what's possible and how to shape our future
in a modern industrial society like ours.

#### The Motorcycle Diaries – Ernesto Che Guevara
Vivid description of a continent, culture, travel, colonialism and life
in the 60s.
Very well-written. Small and portable book.

#### Hippie – Paulo Coelho
About Paulo's time as a hippie backpacking through Europe. 
Relentless freedom and youthful indiscretion.

#### The Alchemist – Paulo Coelho
Takeaway: "follow your dreams".

#### Disgrace – J. M. Coetzee
I'm not sure why this book won a Booker Prize.

#### The Ministry of Utmost Happiness – Arundhati Roy
Very dense portrait of life in Delhi and India.
Mostly sad. Has a bit of happiness at the end.

#### The Almanac of Naval Ravikant
A modern handy handbook about wealth, happiness, success, and spirituality.
Basically, the text version of Joe Rogan's episode with Naval.
