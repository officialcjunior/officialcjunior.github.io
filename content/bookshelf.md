#### Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind – Yuval Noah Harari
Life-altering insights about human origins, civilization, religion,
empires, science, technology, and human nature.


#### An Era of Darkness: The British Empire in India – Shashi Tharoor
Although the book presents an incessantly one-sided narrative, its descriptions and style of writing is engaging, and does not fail to deliver the unparalleled joy of reading a Tharoor. Here's [my tweet thread](https://twitter.com/chandanaveli/status/1697308569945911338?s=20) about the book.

#### The God of Small Things – Arundhati Roy
Possibly the best English fiction with a story set in Kerala. Incredible storyline and style of writing.

#### The Legends of Khasak – O.V Vijayan
English translation of the best Malayalam novel ever. Timeless. Legendary.
Tags: culturally dense, mythology, religion, perception of time
and place.

#### Zero To One – Peter Theil
Insights about what's possible and how to shape our future
in a modern industrial society like ours.

#### 12 Rules for Life - Jordan Peterson
A good-quality self-improvement book. The first chapter of the book, about the first rule, is one of the most inspiring words I've ever read. I liked how he connected history and evolution in that. Rest
are pretty much like any other self-help books.

#### The Power of Now – Eckhart Tolle
The book looks at spiritual and meditative guidelines and insights of all
major religions from a modern perspective. Some chapters—especially, the
part about listening to your body—are evocative and "works".

#### The Motorcycle Diaries – Ernesto Che Guevara
Vivid description of a continent, culture, travel, colonialism and life
in the 60s.
Very well-written. Small and portable book.

#### Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World – Adam Grant
Sometimes the anecdotes and correlations presented feel loosely connected and specially curated. But one thing that stuck my mind was his data that showed that the best entrepreneurs take calculated-risks and not leap of faiths.

#### Hippie – Paulo Coelho
About Paulo's time as a hippie backpacking through Europe.
About relentless freedom of being alone and youthful indiscretion.

#### The Alchemist – Paulo Coelho
Takeaway: "follow your dreams".

#### Disgrace – J. M. Coetzee
I'm not sure why this book won a Booker Prize.

#### Friendly Ambitious Nerd – Visakan Veerasamy
A collection of ideas to become more friendly and ambitious – an invitation to bring the tamed and scrutinized part of our inner-self forward and manifest with glory. Here's my [Twitter thread](https://x.com/chandanaveli/status/1720796951523016887?s=20) about the book.

#### To Kill a Mockinbird – Harper Lee
Harper Lee's style, imagery and poise forces readers to achieve feats such as finishing the book faster than the reader ever thought was possible.

#### Ntuppuppakkoranendarnnu (My Granddad Had an Elephant!) – Basheer
Good and short novel. Nothing fancy. Basheer also talks a lot about
Islam through Kunjupattumma in the book, which was interesting to read.
Even though the book has a predictable ending, the last chapter was a
satisfying read.

#### The Ministry of Utmost Happiness – Arundhati Roy
Very dense portrait of life in Delhi and India.
Mostly sad. Has a bit of happiness at the end.

#### The Almanack of Naval Ravikant – Eric Jorgenson
A modern handy handbook about wealth, happiness, success, and spirituality.
Basically, the text version of Joe Rogan podcast's episode with Naval.
