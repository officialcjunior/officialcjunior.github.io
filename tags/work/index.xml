&lt;p>Hey, we&amp;rsquo;re back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cadence of these notes will vary like a meandering river as it was not easy to connect different things and also keep the same voice â€“ &amp;ldquo;I am not an expert; I&amp;rsquo;m just writing it down as I fare forward and figure it out&amp;rdquo; throughout the blog. I also feel this blog post lacks a certain standard of emotional density that I thought this would have when I envisioned writing it. Nevertheless, the deliverables of an average blog post on this site: candid accounts of experiences and reflections, with an edge for optimism, can be easily observed even by the accidental audience on this blog post.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
