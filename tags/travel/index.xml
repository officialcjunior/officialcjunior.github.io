More about the trip can be read on a previous post − &lt;a href="notes-from-israel">Notes from Israel&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, I read it again and thought it was post-worthy, so here it is:&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>To get lost in the beauty and the aesthetics of the Old City of Jerusalem, you won&amp;rsquo;t need to try or look closely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The city naturally presents itself—its hills and vineyards, its grandeur and poise—the moment you step inside its walls. Intangible dust of another era: of untold stories and forgotten past rest in its old and narrow pathways—almost palpable to the trivial and mortal souls of the distant wayfarers—which, upon our touch, dissolves and slips away back to its angelic provenance. Hence, just like how Ernesto Che Guevara saw the ancient city of Cuzco, more than one Jerusalems can be summoned and perceived. And to each of these Jerusalems, we shall dedicate our stay.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
